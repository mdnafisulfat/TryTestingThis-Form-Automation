# TryTestingThis-Form-Automation
This project automates a form submission process using Selenium in Python. The automation script is developed in PyCharm and interacts with the form hosted on trytestingthis.netlify.app.


* The script fills out and submits the following fields:


First Name: Text input for the user's first name.

Last Name: Text input for the user's last name.

Gender: Radio buttons to select one gender option.

Choose an option: Dropdown menu to select a single option.

Choose applicable options: Checkboxes to select multiple options.

Long Message: Text area for submitting a longer message.

After filling out the form, the script automatically submits the data. This project is designed for learning basic web automation testing using Selenium in Python.
